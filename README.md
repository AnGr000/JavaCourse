1) Created two files: one for the main program and another for a method class named Lab.
2) Initiated work on the main program file by establishing its initial structure and importing necessary modules.
3) Implemented fundamental functionalities within the Lab class file, including methods for data processing.
4) Added comments to both files to enhance code readability.
5) Commenced drafting the file handling functionality within the main program. Defined functions for file input/output.

1)I created other choices for the menu
2)The first one allows you to see if a word is palindrome so it can be read backwards, you do a character-by-character check
3)The addition of the choice for the calculator; we wanted to reproduce the Windows calculator, with its basic functions. The number or partial value remains in view, the operator is always chosen first
4)Starting to use arrays, I dabbled in creating an additional file where I could have clear array methods, so I created another object called in the main, the difficulty here was that the methods contained in the other class had to be passed as parameters, also called by the function to display them on the screen, inside the switch case
